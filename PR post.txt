Currently, the VAST parser has some issues with no-ad/no creatives files:
- When parsing a no-ad VAST (a VAST element with an optional top level `<Error>` only), the return `response` uses to be `null`. It now returns an empty `ads` array.
- When a file contains an `<Inline>` ad but with no creatives data,  the VAST parser uses to add it into the `response.ads` as if it was a valid ad. It's not added anymore.
- After parsing succesfully a `<Wrapper>` ad, but the `<AdTagURI>` resource isn't a valid XML file, it uses to call the VAST parser callback function with an JS `Error` - `Invalid VAST XMLDocument`. While it makes sens to return such an error, what if the parser has ?


 (while calling `<Error>` URIs with the correct [`ERRORCODE]`).

- Move VAST test files to /test/vastfiles/
- Add unit tests to check error scenarios that can happen while parsing VAST files
